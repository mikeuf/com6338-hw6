			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Tomatoes Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil,
				seasoned with salt and olive oil; it is usually arranged on a plate in restaurant practice. Like pizza Margherita,
				it features the colours of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. In Italy, it is usually served as an antipasto
				(starter), not a contorno (side dish).</p>
				<p>Variations of Caprese salad may include Italian dressing or pesto in place
				of olive oil, or balsamic vinegar in addition to it. Olives may appear, along with rucola or romaine lettuce to
				augment the basil. Oregano or black pepper is sometimes added. Caprese is truly a magical and perfect combination
				of flavors, textures, and freshness: ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, and some kind of drizzle of
				either olive oil or balsamic, or both. You'll need mozzarella, tomatoes, lots of basil, olive oil, salt and pepper,
				and the balsamic reduction.</p>

				<li>Stir balsamic vinegar and honey together in a small saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce
					heat to low, and simmer until the vinegar mixture has reduced to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Set the balsamic
					reduction aside to cool.</li>
				<li>Arrange alternate slices of tomato and mozzarella cheese decoratively on a serving platter. Sprinkle with salt
					and black pepper, spread fresh basil leaves over the salad, and drizzle with olive oil and the balsamic reduction.</li>
